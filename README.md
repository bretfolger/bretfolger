Hello everyone, I’m Bret Folger

I recently finished a master's degree at the Bren School at UCSB focusing in Conservation Planning. I'm interesting in using R and GIS
for conservation purposes, whether they be habitat mapping, climate change induced home-range shifts, key stakeholder identification,
the list goes on... . I've used GIS for more than 6 years and R for 2 and am always learning new things. I love spending time outdoors 
gardening, hiking, diving, swimming, or surfing. I am also a big fan of live music - anything that can make me boogie. Please reach out 
on Twitter if you are interested in chatting, sharing code, or have any projects you think I may be able to help out with.
